/comment=REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
reference sequence was derived from AL928889.14, AK029177.1 and
AL928813.10.
On Nov 30, 2012 this sequence version replaced NM_007389.4.
Summary: This gene encodes an alpha subunit of the muscle-derived
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a pentameric neurotransmitter
receptor and member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily.
The alpha subunit plays a role in substrate binding and channel
gating. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2012].
Sequence Note: This RefSeq record was created from transcript and
genomic sequence data to make the sequence consistent with the
reference genome assembly. The genomic coordinates used for the
transcript record were based on transcript alignments.
Publication Note:  This RefSeq record includes a subset of the
publications that are available for this gene. Please see the Gene
record to access additional publications.
COMPLETENESS: complete on the 3' end.
